## Overview

**Foodies** is a full stack web app for users to organize all of their favorite recipes and meal plans, as well as connect with and follow other users for endless meal time inspiration. The layout structure of the app is inspired by Spotify's interface.


<br>

## MVP


<br>

_The **Foodies** MVP will be the basic foundation for this app to grow more complex with time. It will allow a user to register, and log in and out of their personal account. While logged into their account they will be able to create, view, edit and delete their own receipes._

<br>

## Goals

<br>

### Back End / Server
- _Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints_
- _Build a database with at least 2 tables and at least one association between tables._
- _Uitlize Rails to define models for interacting with the database_
- _Implement Full CRUD via working generic controller methods (index, show, create, update, delete)_
- _Back End deployed via Heroku_


<br>

### Front End / Client
- _Build a functional and interactive React app having at least 8 separate, rendered components  in an organized React file structure_
- _Consume data from Ruby on Rails API (Back End) and render that data in components on Front End_
- _Utilize React Router for client-side routing_
- _Demonstrate Full CRUD actions (index, show, create, update, delete) on the front end_
- _Fully functional Front End deployed via Surge or Netlify_

<br>

### Miscellanous

- _Implement media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes including desktop_
- _All code is written in a clean and readable manner utilizing high-quality semantic variable names, proper indentation and appropriate case conventions_



<br>
